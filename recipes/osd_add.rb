# This recipe will add OSDs once the physical device has been added.

# IMPORTANT: Use this recipe *ONLY* if you just want to add OSD devices and *NOT* have them included as part of the
# actual ['ceph']['osd']['devices'] array. *IF* you want to add the devices on a more permanent basis then *ADD* the
# given device to the ['ceph']['osd']['devices'] array and call *OSD.rb* recipe instead!

# TODO: Add an osd provider that creates an osd, removes an osd and starts/stops an osd.
# It can also reweight an osd so as to bring down a number of them gracefully so that they
# can be safely removed instead of just stopping the osd and removing from the crush map.
