# This recipe will simply turn scrubbing off. There is another recipe that turns scrubbing on.
# NOTE: This recipe should be called before any maintenance on Ceph is performed.
# MAKE SURE to call osd_scrubbing_on recipe as soon as you can after performing the maintenance.
# If osd_scrubbing_off is off too long then a possible "scrubbing storm" may occur and impact
# performance.
