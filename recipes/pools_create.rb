# Allows for you to define pools for whatever group you wish such as 'radosgw' or 'rbd' or both.
# There is a pools.rb attribute that sets default pool names based on pool types ('radosgw', 'rbd')
# along with settings for each. The settings are applied to ALL pool names in the given list for the given type.
# All of those values can be overridden using the override_attributes in your environment.yaml file.
