# NOTE: There is a default erasure coding profile built into Ceph. However, it is highly recommended that you
# create other profiles. Also, once a pool has been created using erasure coding it can NOT be changed. If you wish
# to change the pool you will actually need to create a new pool with a different erasure coding profile and
# then move the objects from the old pool to the new pool and then remove the old pool.

# There are recipes here that help do the moving of the objects (future)
