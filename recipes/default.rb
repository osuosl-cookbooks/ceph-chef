# NOTE: The location of netaddr-1.5.1.gem is defaulted to /tmp. If one exists there then it will install that gem. If not,
# then it will install from the net. The purpose is to be able to supply all pre-reqs for those environments that
# are not allowed to access the net.

# FYI: If you're behind a firewall or no net access then you can install netaddr with the following after then node
# has been bootstrapped with Chef - /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install --force --local /tmp/netaddr-1.5.1.gem
# Of course, this means you have downloaded the gem from: https://rubygems.org/downloads/netaddr-1.5.1.gem and then
# copied it to your /tmp directory.
