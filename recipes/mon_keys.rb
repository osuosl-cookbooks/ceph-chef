# The name of the recipe, mon_keys, is prefixed with 'mon' so as to indicate the grouping of the recipe since it must
# be ran after mon_start.

# This recipe can only be ran AFTER a monitor has started
# NOTE: This recipe will create bootstrap keys for OSD, [MDS, RGW automatically]

# Create/save/etc the bootstrap-osd key
include_recipe 'ceph-chef::bootstrap_osd_key'

# # IF the bootstrap key for bootstrap-rgw exists then save it so it's available if wanted later. All bootstrap
# # keys are created during this recipe process!

#   block do
#     fetch = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("ceph-authtool '/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-rgw/#{node['ceph']['cluster']}.keyring' --print-key --name=client.bootstrap-rgw")
#     fetch.run_command
