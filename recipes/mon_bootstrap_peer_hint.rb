# NOTE: This recipe (optional) can be used to aid in initial bootstrapping of ceph mons. Depending on how automated
# install is configured the recipe may be needed. It is not included in roles by default.

# Failure may occur when the cluster is first created because the peers may no exist yet so ignore it.
# Gets executed each time chef-client is ran which is ok
